# Changelog

Changes are documented in reverse chronological order by release.

## 1.2.x

### Deprecated

- Renamed the old namespace `P3\` to `pine3ree\` and added temporary migration
  file with old class names as aliases of the corresponding new ones.

### Changed

- Possible BC break: the `int` return type was removed from `PDO::exec()` as, 
  per pdo-docs, it may also return `false`

- Possible BC break: the string return type declaration was removed from
  PDO::lastInsertId() as, per pdo-docs it may also return `false`.

- BC break: lastInsertId() now returns `false` if not connected instead of the
  empty string. When migrating from previous versions we suggest to simply
  type-cast to string the result.

- Possible BC break: the string return type declaration was removed from
  `PDO::quote()` as, per pdo-docs, it may also return false
